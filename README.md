## 📋 Overview

Chronos Frontend is a full-featured client application I built to solve a common challenge among students: effectively tracking study progress across multiple courses. The platform combines task management with data visualization to provide actionable insights into study habits and time allocation.

This project represents my journey in building production-ready React applications with modern tooling and best practices, including type safety, efficient state management, and responsive design principles.
